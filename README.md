# Privacy Policy for My Personal Upload Utility

**Last Updated:** [Current Date, e.g., May 18, 2024]

This Privacy Policy outlines how "My Personal Upload Utility" (hereinafter referred to as the "Utility") handles information. This Utility is a software tool developed for my personal and exclusive use on my local computer. It is not distributed or made available to other users. The Utility is designed to interact with online platforms (such as TikTok) via their provided APIs or web interfaces, as directed by me, its sole user.

## Information Handled by the Utility

As a locally-run, personal tool, the Utility interacts with the following information solely on my computer and under my direct control:

1.  **Platform Credentials & Authentication Tokens:**
    *   To perform actions on online platforms (e.g., TikTok), the Utility requires me to input my login credentials for those platforms or to complete an OAuth 2.0 authentication flow.
    *   Any authentication tokens (e.g., access tokens, refresh tokens) obtained from these platforms are stored locally on my computer. These tokens are used only to authorize the Utility to perform actions on my behalf, as I instruct it.
    *   My platform passwords, if entered directly (for interactions not supporting OAuth for this Utility's purpose), are handled locally by the Utility to facilitate login and are not transmitted to any third party other than the intended platform.

2.  **Content and Metadata:**
    *   Video files and associated information (captions, descriptions, tags) that I select for processing are accessed from my local computer.
    *   This content and metadata are transmitted to the designated online platform(s) only when I initiate an upload or management action through the Utility.

3.  **Local Configuration:**
    *   The Utility may store configuration settings locally on my computer for my convenience (e.g., file paths, default settings). This data remains on my local machine.

## How My Information is Used

*   All information handled by the Utility is used strictly for its intended functions as a personal tool to interact with the specified online platforms under my direction.
*   The Utility does **not** collect, analyze, or transmit any of my personal data or content to any external servers, services, or third parties, other than the target online platforms (e.g., TikTok) during an action I explicitly initiate (like an upload).

## Data Storage and Sharing

*   All data handled by this Utility, including credentials, tokens, and configuration, is stored locally on my personal computer.
*   No data is shared with any third party by the Utility itself. Any sharing of content occurs directly between my local Utility instance and the target online platform, as per my instructions and subject to that platform's own Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

## Security

*   I am responsible for the security of my computer, my online platform accounts, and the credentials I use with this Utility.

## Scope

This Privacy Policy applies only to my personal use of this locally-run Utility. It is not intended for, nor does it cover, any distributed software or service.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

Should I modify this Utility in a way that materially changes how information is handled, I will update this document.

## Contact

This is a personal utility; no formal contact or support is provided.
